# Netflix_Analysis_using_SQL

This project is an SQL analysis of the Netflix dataset. The dataset contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of 2021.

# Netflix Data Analysis using SQL

This project is about analyzing Netflix's data using SQL. We have a table: `Netflix_data`. The `Netflix_data` table contains information about the shows, such as the release date, Netflix release date, and other features.

## Database Setup

First, we create the `Netflix_data` table then, we add the `Release_Date` and `Netflix_Release_Date` columns to the table and alter the table according to requirements.

## Data Analysis

We perform several analyses on the data:

1. **Series vs. Movie**: We determine which among the two categories (Series vs. Movie) is more present in the Netflix product catalog.

2. **Top 3 Genres**: We identify the top 3 genres which are mostly requested by the viewers or most popular within two categories.

3. **Hidden Gems**: We find the hidden gems under the two main categories. Hidden gems are films with fewer reviews but with very high ratings.

4. **Top Rated Series and Movies**: We find the top rated Series and Movies based on IMDB score.

5. **Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic Scores**: We analyze how the Rotten tomatoes score & Metacritic score is varying for each Series/Movies and calculate the combined score.

6. **Most Awarded Movies/Series**: We find out which movies/series has received the most number of awards.

7. **Total Box-office Collection for FY 2020-21**: We calculate the Year-wise and Month-wise Total Box-office Collection for the FY 2020-21.

8. **Productivity per Year on Netflix**: We measure the Productivity per year on Netflix.

9. **Correlation between IMDB Votes and BOX Office**: We check if there is any correlation between IMDB Votes and BOX Office.

Please note that the SQL queries for these analyses are not included in this README. They are part of the SQL script that you run to perform the analyses.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use SQL for data analysis. By analyzing Netflix's data, we can gain insights into show popularity, genre performance, and viewing trends over the years. This can be useful for viewers, artists, and producers alike. Happy analyzing! ðŸ˜Š
